    "So far, \n",
    "* we know our way around Jupyter Notebooks. \n",
    "     * creating and saving notebooks. \n",
    "     * editing text and programs. \n",
    "     * submitting assignments. \n",
    "* we know how to code basic things in Python/iPython within notebooks.\n",
    "     * assignment\n",
    "     * iteration\n",
    "     * conditionals\n",
    "     * functions\n",
    "* we know the various data structures available in python/iPython: \n",
    "     * lists -- for sequences that can change size.\n",
    "     * tuples -- for things with positional meaning. \n",
    "     * sets -- for sets without duplicates. \n",
    "     * dicts -- for things that are filed by keyword. \n",
    "     * classes -- for data and functions that work together. \n",
    "* and we've been exposed to some deeper concepts in Python and programming in general. \n",
    "     * *encapsulation* -- recording sequences for reuse. \n",
    "     * *preconditions and postconditions* -- how to reuse cells for new tasks. \n",
    "     * *stringification* -- how python allows classes to control how they're printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, however, we've been working at a fairly deep level in the guts of python. The reality is that: \n",
    "* Data scientists function in Python at a *higher level of abstraction*. \n",
    "* Thus, it is necessary to apply the principles above to *software and patterns written by others.* \n",
    "* Survival and effective function thus requires that we adopt a *consumer approach to python programming.*\n",
    "* *Classes rule.* People have written very powerful classes that utilize the mechanisms I've shown you to raise the level of abstraction in how you program. \n",
    "* You will very seldom interact with the primitive data structures we've seen so far. Instead, we'll interact with classes that accomplish tasks more easily. \n",
    "* *These classes require a new and different set of skills.*\n",
    "\n",
    "# A personal note\n",
    "At this point in the course, I am *straining to avoid* turning you into master Python programmers. Actually, that isn't needed. Instead, I need to turn you into master *consumers* of other peoples' Python programs. That is -- indeed -- a somewhat distinct skill. \n",

    "# Data abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data abstraction* refers to the practice of encapsulating ideas about data in classes, and using class methods instead of lower-level python code to accomplish tasks. In a data abstraction situation, \n",
    "* Classes are opaque. You should not need to read the code of a class to use it. \n",
    "* Class methods are documented via *preconditions* (also called *prerequisites*) and postconditions (also called *results*).  \n",
    "* Thus, each class enforces a *contract* with you, that if you give it what it needs, it will provide you with what you need. \n",
    "* Classes are not part of python; they are imported. You only need to import a class once per workbook, in a cell before you use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# What you need to know in order to use a class\n",
    "* (*Installs:* what do you need to install via `pip install`)\n",
    "* *Imports:* what do you need to import? \n",
    "* *Usage:* what are class methods? What do they do? \n",
    "\n",
    "# An example: okpy\n",
    "* Imports: `from client.api.notebook import Notebook`\n",
    "* Installs: `pip install okpy`  (I did this for you in https://jupyterhub.cs.tufts.edu)\n",
