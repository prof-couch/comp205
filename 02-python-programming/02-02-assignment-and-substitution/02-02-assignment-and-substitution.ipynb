    "The most important principle of Python programming for data science is the *principle of substitution*: \n",
    "\n",
    "> If x = {some mess}, and one writes an expression of {some mess}, \n",
    "> then one can substitute x for {some mess} in the expression \n",
    "> with exactly the same results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply this in several circumstances. There are three independent circumstances that come up regularly: \n",
    "* substitution of data. \n",
    "* substitution of functions. \n",
    "* substitution of anonymous functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, we could do everything without substitution. The purpose of all of these substitution principles is *readability* and *reuseability*. \n",
